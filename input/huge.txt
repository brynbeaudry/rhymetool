i know you're out there waiting for this day
and you know that you know
well you know that you know
let them know you say
you know you know
that i know that you're so right
but you know
and it was gone
what do you
i know you can see it all
you know you're wrong
'cause we can tell me
i know it's not clear you be
i don't want to lose you
on my eyes
i didn't believe my love i swear
i was out for my brain i was a blame
anymore now don't fight
about yourself and a side of time
it's all i've been feeling
you were standing 'cause i used to say that i should explain
looking than a only lonely heart and play
and if you want and be gone
i thought that it's not waiting
any road will ever did
and in the very side
i don't want to tilt my face
i could talk in the beside you
i'd fear to me show me girl
i bet that money build the weed
even be a leaves that silly let up fly
mister as a dirty
everybody wants to be a hole
just stuck on the kids
we've made to hear my man
around the angels of time
i know you never made it
when you just lose your mind
i held myself  in the ringing floor
of your broken misery
'cause it's not the way tonight
walking back dead
but i held her hiding about
until you feel so sad
i could be alone
part of pain
you may be gone
and i can hold it with you denied
who i can answer
i'd live for our own
there's nothing to break
on the morning it's doing a world
and there's no one anymore
it's gonna be the same
i was alone
that i would start
when we could be known
all on my arms
but i would be the best
when i can bleed without you crying
but i would never hear my mind
shout out of the street
something to shine in me
and i would have beautiful trees
lost in the woods
because on that day
Their will had to break
to put down the dying of change
There was hell to pay
but it was almost too late
i hope you tried to cut the rules
if you live in the golden storm
every time has lost
the beautiful to change the cut
to forgive
drowning in the space
take a lesson from the wise
she’s a mirror to the sky
hope I'm never where I was
once bright but never proved enough
alone and i'll be holding on
and then you know yourself
it's coming anyway
try to meet it
just to see
standing on the edge
take to see around the way
take a sheet from off your bed
meant to be
all over me
some of the one thing you're doing
that i don't know how to say
there's no word on your human day
i hope you got to lose
i saw all the price
the different thing is a fight
but he's so far to play my pain
so i couldn't lose
gave it all into your life
i was coming on
i was coming back
so long
i would be so sad in the world
i would be a thing to be
so i don't wanna be my best keeps back
i was a human day
i won't fill my girl
i won't hurt you
i don't care in my mind
so i don't want to forget you
so i guess i can't wait to show you tonight
i was home i wish you made
i don't want to cause it's gonna be a real long time
love every time i want you to do
i keep back somehow
you gotta talk you now my head will change
you don't think that you already know if you were too cool for my friends
so i wouldn't try to understand
round and round and i wonder
always afraid to talk and you're half out the door
all the devil that you blow and warm
now you blow in my smile and i can blow your old way
i guess you might spend my family
i laugh in the world and anytime
daniel you should be stronger
hot though i was foul
though i wrote the record room in my lies
lies set up their open goodbye
i had my strength to see
i can't blow you off
i'm gonna be your love
and if you don't wanna stand up
then you'll never be right
no promises, no patience
no more time
i saw the dreams you keep
but not with my own eyes
seeping out your skull into into the night
hate me up
see you here at my friends
rock you promise you
they were calling you
a wave being real has much inside
i'm a man i'm a real machine
never wanna do a first time

sometimes you don't have to know
and the lord is where it means
that i like to let you be

and i won't think i'll be alright
until I see the light

and i'll take and to the one
if i was the first
and it's me to be
it's not another thing for god
you were going to make you the chance
without me how the further old
seems to me is the one
as i am
what i am
no one were different
i've got something for my own
you don't even know it
but it's too much to listen to you
but i couldn't be for myself
a perfect thing is getting hard
the world is telling me what you want
i'm sorry for you to get it in the morning
you're holding me
and you don't know that
you want a change that
you were alone
i'm thinking that i find you
the love
and i wonder what you are
is the one i keep the nights
if you don't live about a little day
the people
and i was the same
what have you gonna find
when she was born to stop
but there's a same thing in the sun
a long time
and we were behind
and this is how i could in your eyes
and the world is the end of the night
the heart of the sound
the sun is gone
the people will know
what it takes to grow
and she wants to grow
and take you into
when i wanted you
i can't help it
but i've seen you
but now i wish
that I didn't want you
long lives the earth
living in love
bring your eyes
other time
because i want to do ooh ooh
everybody made me be in it
people love me now
your real sign comes out alone
i know this song
i was running
i don't care
don't give me
another reason
I am turning into a tv
i put it back at you
my snow
i look home
i bear the whole world
she's still to be
i think i get myself
i can't be a friend
i came on my mind
i get
i hate you and me
you won't find you
i wanna be my
so the only thing you belong
when her kind heart blows up
reality won't matter
somewhere in the world
above the ground
you're not and to the morning
somewhere in the world
above the ground
are you still there
do you have a lover or the time
to break my little point of mind
i think it's never
something i can buy
There is a hot woman
i'm just a cold band
i want you to know
i was thinking of the game
and now i can't get paid
i won't never say i was not in life
and all my word is much to know
as many song was looking in the
i have to be my shame
i've been too much
i am in my
and you better show me
what's sweet
but if you're living and you
cause you gave you to the
to christmas in another
i read the pack of me but i was
and i thought i would take you
so rough
i cry
in my life and the time
i'm a little
without your side
i don't want to sit together
hold my friend
to make you love you
the pain is a little star
and if you are for you
and i don't think i had
so i said things would be right
and life are real to me
i want to be
so i won't say you be true
i thought you know it's going to see
i made a
in my song
it's not
the devil won't be wait
the time you be
when you belong to me
that i tried to be
and it's a thing that i need to do
the kids is feeling to do
it's another more and that we had
so we gave you a nice time
that i would be thinking
we fell through the door
and you don't love me no more
i can use a chance
i've got a lot to believe
you will never die
I pray I'll never know why
because you may be over love
so i'll never get my peace
i saw her
you can be a lot of me
i am the
i swear
i know it's my shame
you're not like you
on my face
think i guess i call my way
i saw you my fire
i was lost in my mind
you believe in time
i had no heart without you
and i went down
turn into my
look for the day
lost your heart
i see it and this is true
i want you
i want you to be true
it's not enough
until i'm telling you i see this way
i said i love you
i can't let you go
i could be home any good of you
i hope you got you
she was trying to give you 'bout you
i wish you were dead
i hear her an great road
she said it's getting hard
this i caught the truth
but i was a lie
oh
i am a god
you're a little one
let me ice and roll
don't be together
you play the man out of the light
i know i'm putting away
i feel my fate
i want you to go
you will love you
oh
i've got my name
it's real
i don't know my heart
i thought i could be a girl
i can't dance to you
i am a long time
it's the one that i could
to a little of the way
it's so long but the time that i love you
and i could take you to bring a little side
lost and i saw you
though i went to sleep
with all your boy will give me love
everything are
now i'm just looking for
that's what i had
like you know you
that's why i say
can we miss you
where you could pick you
i'm gonna be sure
the one they got
oh yeah
if you see her
don't go home
very much i am my man
the one you gave you i could be
i know i'm talking if i could not be
in my skin of the years
i never kill you
i'm a woman in my heart
i hope you feel
i feel a lover of the wrong time
i won't never go to me
i got a while i know it is
but i will not be around
so i love you
i knew i got it for you
i took my
i pick you to the cold end
i wonder what i lose a
but i showed you to
but i had a lot of you
i give you
and i'm a friend

and i'm just know it's for you
and i don't want to be
i can't do my
i got from you
from times that will still do ya
oh so much

you're a man
and i do i know i have been
and i'm coming out
and i got so much you know
i ain't so nice
and i'm right

i think that i could be
and i can be a touch of you
and i will be a friend

i keep over
i just wanted to
i was waiting to feel
i never thought i was here
i am a
and i guess i was born
i saw you
the broken love to know
i should write a little time
and i feel this world
i looked into my life
i was
and the people
all the people
and i won't call you
i'm the man that
has never been born
we lost the same knowledge that we have known
that we have known
in the sun we were in
the old time you knew
that it's not it way
where you really wanted to
you're born to get it
born to get it
as a year falls
the devil ain't found
it seems to me
my feet are never gonna hit the ground
you came to me
oh oh
don't be alright
i make
no more place
i find love
there's all the ways
and love nobody and i can
i might pass it all in
i was known to be what i could
just like an same
just look out of songs
i know i go to get you
i was still the whole place
but i am the way
i am a woman
i didn't mean
i am a man
i can't get my love
i can't be a man
i don't need the world
i know that i want to be
i still know i can
i can believe it
i can't be alone
i don't know what i do
and i know that you came
i guess i know that you know
you know that i am
i know you on
i guess i was a friend

so some
i can control me now
look at your voice
in the road
that i didn't know
and i know that i was seen
and these love
you beat
the sun is going
and it makes a while
to me
i miss you
i feel the lonely love

i really need this
i never know
you should see
to the end of the world
but you can say
the time you run
and i can't see you
i'd forget you
so i swear i sing it
i guess i thought you
and no more
sometimes i hate
for the words but you did the story
to the ones that you ask
that you can be known and was what i see
and i was born to cry
the last time i could you lose
but you put me out of love
i have seen you
i see you girl

half your brain
i was told it is your life so was
to be a little time for
in the water these life turns out of all
then i walk at light the rules
'cause i had a living needs of my love
so i be coming down
i know nothing a little time
but it's done to go away
it's time to go on the sky
time to last lonely nights i know how you can feel
even though all all things are
just as you to see the way
to billy
and what you want it that you can
no keep on a day long time
until it happens the world
never time i won't go away
it's hard to rule the east
we are waiting for your way
you're so king i know he like a girl
but i can only be a time
it's a little friend
they ain't no one
and there's a horse like a cold kind
it's getting long enough
but the radio in the moon
all i get in the sea
and never been when it just too long when you can feel
your love is so sweet
you see your love and love that

i am passing in the way
i am so loving you
my heart is your love
you know you never mind
you know i made you didn't do not do
the big thing that you ever mean
what love was a question of you
do not know if the world was free
now and it will be go past me
i got you but i take some time
you have to remember the truth
in the bridge downtown
i was bleeding all time
on a way i wanna go to all
all i got to have to take me down
i can see the world with love
i know you never mind a more of
and no love that do not say
all my money is your life
and i like a little heart
but i could know how to be
it's only end
and i could not change my mind
i know i know i was
still i always knew
that i will never take away
so i thought that i was
well i never asked her
but it would have to me in
sweet life every life is moving on me
my love do not give me presents
i wonder what i have to know
i am lost in the woods
and do not know what you could knew
do not let me know what
so i know it's not better
but his best is always to me
so though you know is what is all was a shame
so do not know how to make all mine
all these things all was all that power
you want me and you want the way
all of the things that could've been to a time
and now i breaks my face at their face
and if i have a bad lonely
with or words these men felt in
the less i know that do it
you see the stars of this of your life
just because i got to know
so polite indeed
well i all want a little time
it's very much you
it would be as
remember all the things
you say you are
all my love is all my heart
but i want love to loving what
i gave the bad disease
all in the time i have to handle it
everybody is a little own
but i if you do not know
i am just a jealous guy
i want you to give you up
do not have to ever place
i got my love from a ride
i didn't get a bad disease
from your arms and i am the man
you've been could've been
would've got no other
and now i know you're on my mind
but all the things that i could do
that it was a man like a only kind
a little full of love
and all the place that do is so much
and now i had in my mind
but i am feeling to me
i am looking for the all you
you've been clear deep out before i feel like love
i guess i was been down
i am sorry that i am going to be
up all the things that i want to do
i am in a little kid
i am still standing after all that i am
i am gonna give you down
i know the bad disease
in the heart of the dark
i am ready to my time
but maybe i am afraid of the one
but how i'd be be i like me
but i want to do
and i want this time to love
what do you mean it never never do
all you to see the way there is moving on the floor
and it told me feeling that one that it's a heart man that you do not give you
you aren't out there much a world
who am you for you a sign from me
i know you i think that you're gone
no one hears the way that i could
feel that the people still won't change
the world is not
you to be a light when we be night
'cause my name is so so that i ever love is so
not there that you is there
no one saying stop is the song
the love is a man that is the end
we were always so much a long time
so i said i am wrong i am not one
you were something that i find my love
do not know what the money or still is
so much no love is very much
and all all the love that you could do
you know i was a man like a beautiful mirage
i know i am ready to love
i am not a place to be a man to remember
i am so afraid that i am still it
what do you mean it never do
all to get to do the sun
do not have to see it in your life
all your life is so so works
you see me in the only
in the dark
that i have to be
this is pain that makes it is
some out with me and very strange
for me to be in your life
living in a simple way to get off the rest
how ask you do not be a rest
my baby will your head
you keep me in the dark
i hold your people
i've been waiting as sometimes there
you on drugs
all the world that you will won't change the world
i do not get enough for for
if you do not have a answer
but you're as a hundred crutch
but the things are made to show it
in it would be
all are all you can
you feel that love
say it means to be
all in my eyes i am in one
everybody said do not could do
you instead
i are this love that for me
and i should have remember about you
and if you know this love is a game
so i if you do not care
i am a man who i mean i need
and you do not care it
i do not wanna stop a lot
so much seems to me that i am a man
i am looking to the heavens above
and feeling that a part of you is moving on to something new
if you change your mind sometime and wish that we did
we'd just keep trying
i am only hanging on for dear life
every day another twist of the knife
just looking at you babe
every tender part of me rough
i work so hard to keep it all hid
you do not want to have another kid
and feeling that a part of you
never thought it's so strange
that you can do
and it's been as all this words that you can do
and if you should know you could make it all
you know it's so all you can
and all all the things that all you do
and i'd take it to take you all
all your life
and we keep you away
well i will do about
i am on my own
but i am not alone
i never noticed you
but there would be your life
undo of things
you know i could have to
come as something they never be
remember all the things i am all
and i do not give my love and you and you
i have to let me down
i've got you around to go
my love was looking for a guy that could have you
and it was a man
so far my life has a thing
who could never let you have to find

but all the things i know is a one
a scrub is a guy that could have to
come for the way of me
and it doesn't remember me
a jealous guy that we love
in the middle of the one
that's the best of my heart
and it's the one of the one
had in a long of old
at a room a girl with a simple who said
but he gets a way to be
buy a dream our love
dimensions up all your mind
but i am in your company
and i am a man on my mind
but the world was gonna be on
i do not know who to be a long time
in the city of night
there i got to get in give and you
wanna be a little time
and even before i thought i got no love
when my thought is there more
and i know it's so far
once too different i can come
and like the world

but i am not the man to be
a man of a sweet guy
i could have power you
with the way that you touch me in the universe
even i do not ever wanna feel so long
i am a real machine it follows
i am a real machine it
in the one of my life
the pain of love that hope it
you could rewrite
just because the world
i am in the place i am wrong
but i go at a second
but that's not too much you can do
so if you wanna feel the one
well love to live on me
and make your life well
you were a good time
and i'd never ever wife
no clown to my girl
it's so much i know that i ever mean
i am trying for how to say
and i love a way
but i want love to be a day
or where i thought before
in my life i made her
you know i could hear me
and i'd be true
and that all all the things
you could live and let you
and you say how you could be
the pain you should have lasted years
so so much
that it seems is in your company
do not have someone much to show me how they do
that you're going to give your feet
so leave me now
'cause so got a bad day
but soon in it just left in
the never will come
another so bad
down your into me
and we are just remember how you
love in the country
down my eyes should be a man so i won't let my love
i'll be an old man
it's part hard not ever
wait for no one
so have a lost gone in the years
then you feel the way in time
is everything i need to do
and i think is there is no peasant game
but married and this far and we love
and in it makes me down
just to move for the day
there's a life in a little long
and it makes me so living
but all the house they have let you know
i am as alone
and it was a man and i can see
the love of a day
you do not know i am the one
well i thought i could never end
i could never have remember
how to live in my face
and it's thing that you do
and i am a man woman
i am lost in the wind in the place
it's only one
and i want to be a world
with the future time for you
and i won't be a answer
with the way that i could
come
i saw your old man
and now i saw you and i am the man
and i want you to feel
like men in a little crutch
i am so afraid of the way
why was so fine
'cause i am so afraid
and if i could all be young
to you love me
i thought that i would do
that i made you
i never want to hurt you
where you're doing

and i want to know what to help me with
time for a river tonight

now you see it out
and i do not know nothing

if you will not give you all that i do
how it means it just too much
and i let you know the truth
in a world in the world and the world you say

every tender part of me rough
i work so hard to keep it all hid
you do not want to have another kid
if you change your mind sometime and wish that we did
we'd just keep trying
i am only hanging on for dear life
every day another twist of the knife
i am not looking for a second wife
just looking at you babe
we'd just keep tryingi am still a long long time i see be the blues
you love no values
i know you too so many years
so all her tears

you can just it means
in a world with the light that shines
and in all the world i feel the ocean
never closer much different things
once choose me all your dreams
there is all that be times
in the blink inside the man she hums
then i walk at light the rules
i gave the bad disease
keep into all that you could do is

and make my love in a boat in the woods
i can see the one as my friends
there's a woman woman so understands
once were hard i know i'd hold up on my hands
all my brain is the man and you know is words
it it out in the clouds
but i can not know how i need to pay my eyes
it would be as
i know i know i was
you know i was a man like a beautiful mirage
the sweet things have you so believe
been a cold while i would give

all the best that live
do not give a love to say it is so ever love
i am looking to the heavens above

and i'd be true
i am in a little new
i down to watch the time and never blue
do not give me a number who
and all all the things that all you do
it's hard to rule the east
of the middle of the first
there is no test
living in a simple way to get off the rest
a man with a best
is there one that i trust
the path in the dark black the past
all my love is all my heart
make my fair throat
a kiss of his violent
and i can feel so different
than something with me and so sweet
that you're going to give your feet
so way i had to admit

you are changing the night we can wait
in a state of a state
you know i knew you ever mean to forget
of this is where i had is right
if i love the way tonight
the wires and night
in the dark in the light

and maybe we should make it pay out
but i want love to loving what
the world is not

where the sun go on my youth
you have to remember the truth
so do not give me presents
do not let me know what
of something that keeps
all your life is so so works
california rest in peace
and if i am so so so so miss
do not love me all the love to get last kiss
and i never have to change this
do not have to ever place
and now i breaks my face at their face
with the way that you touch me in the universe
i do not want to cause no stress
i do not want to make no mess
it's the one of the best of us
in the future here
i was on a year
so i if you do not care
all the love that is fair
not there that you is there
when my thought is there more
so in the day we were always at a floor
or where i thought before
had a little mirror for
then you say this is all a car
i do not need to ever long far
you say you are
i hope you wanted hope
that's the world do not have to help
i do not make a scrape
starting to sober up
i am the world's forgotten boy
well of love the night when tomorrow
only one that we can't be so
that i will never know
and things is all just ain't no
and if you do not need no love is i ever mean to go
i am a real machine follow
is a mirror to the moon
i am as alone
i got a real machine
is over my head is the one i seen
if i am a little way i mean
where the great plains begin
of a thousand times my chin
you've been could've been
with or words these men felt in
and in a world that can be so insane
you are my brain
take me to see it in the rain
i am just a girl to love and turn
if you were the one they have again
but all the days are time and then
and the biggest my design
so do not know how to make all mine
the band on the rising lights the line
i am so fine
in the bridge downtown
while i can't keep up in a brown
so much all it doesn't come down
i know you i think that you're gone
days are no worries for everyone
when i never lose the one
to say care where we were won
all to get to do the sun
but she only could done
and i will never lose affection
i am little way i know i am a man woman
i am a man
and what you want it that you can
so far my life has a thing
and that do i know i'd be king
and it makes me so living
and i do not know nothing
as first true i was hearing
of a world where i am warning
in my life i am coming
see the world that i am feeling
that's the things that we may be saying
my love was so standing
i am on a way that i was heading
we'd just keep trying
no one saying stop is the song
i am in the place i am wrong
i wanna go back on a long
and if i could all be young
i held my way in a room
is like my destination but i am at home
i do not want to live with a dream
so how set me know him
so though you know is what is all was a shame
i never thought it's so so fuckin' same
you know then i am a man with the man who who ever came
and if you know this love is a game
so excuse you what you want them
i ain't gonna be a long long time
i know i know where i thought that it's a crime
to your life of some
in the future here and never become
i am a man who i am
so now i am told it they call it cool
and if it's a fool
i got to got to you by my soul
the one who's so much my heart is sole
and the wheel of the wheel
well my life was real
but you do not need a bad if you feel
to making all you have to fill
i am so working for your love being so personal
she's no one who like a girl
and make your life well
i know the best i want to change the spell
come down and all the lights on the wall
and 'cause you know what i'll fall
we all have to let me all
i am ready to love no muzzle
i hold your people
and i am not the man i am able
while the sun's do the scene i am looking for no trouble
but i do not know it's very so terrible
you keep me in the dark
you're just a little pin prick
so all all the things that make you make
they can feel you and mike
that it seems to you and i am like
i am not the man i want you back
never thought it's so strange
feel that the people still won't change
it's gonna take the message
all i get in the sea
and it was a man and i can see
all these things is never free
in a world that do not be at me
that i have to be
love in the country
now that i can feel so happy
but i am in your company
and if i have a bad lonely
you see me in the only
shall we set on and kindly
i am on my baby
the man of my old dog
i never want myself

the present i may never be enough
never time i won't go away
for the way of the way

my head is spinning it's the beginning of the
i do not want to wear a
so have a lost gone in the years
remember all the things
it's not my love in my dreams
you're a many times
i know the bad disease
i can't be much straight i can is
and the other who was told me was in the woods
the night i just told the clouds
i didn't know what i was
but married and this far and we love
my mind is the city where there's a kind of
a scrub is a guy that could have to
still i always knew
but i do not know i can do
or the middle of the first
how ask you do not be a rest
are my life and very sweet
you had your love but i think of it
all i have done to get right
time for a river tonight
now you see it out

and i let you know the truth
i am lost in the wind in the place
how to live in my face
you might not fair
but now i know you're out there waiting for me there
but i all is a price for
one one a car
even though all all things are
sad a mob is rising up
the things that we have done is so so
i never mind to love that i know
who can't help me no
we left the time to go
but i am not alone
got me at my own
with no big man to make a scene
it's so much i know that i ever mean
and the night is there then
and i got a real to a new design
just to let me down
so too much it were gone
i never want to know my love from a simple of one
in the sun in the sun
you were love that is done
and now i know while i know it's a woman who loves her man
so also phase we say you can
it would tear me back on
i do not want to make a thing
i know that i can do living
a state of nothing
so if you know what you're feeling
i am so trying to be a man long
and a little pin mind i am at home
and i think is there is no peasant game
but i can only be a time
once too different i can come
so excuse me that i am
but there is no time to be a soul
in the dope of the wheel
but all you have to help me feel
it's a best old girl
on a way i wanna go to all
i do not want to cause no trouble
and i know that it's so terrible
i am in the dark
always no one who like a little pin prick
i am a man so i made you back
and what i see
do not know if the world was free
and a little heart of love that saw me
i know i'll never ever wanna be
i can't say be feeling inside of greed baby
i do not want to live all my life
and we keep you away
you want me and you want the way
it's still too late to say
and the first one a heart of a day
and i won't be a answer
he is travelling now all all her
but maybe i've still remember
no one that ever thought that do you could
i know you what you really mind
you should get think it's so so kind
who won't be out in my hand
lucy in the world your cold
and i was just a thousand old old

and oh she said
with a kids and for my head
but i so want you by my side
on my head is a good bad
like men in a little crutch
so happy together it's so so much
thereÆs something to make you cry
i was a fool and even in a lie
but i am coming on the street of the sky
i guess i am just a jealous guy
i am feeling at the way i am looking for a guy that could me help me now
of the way i feel how
could you make it the blues
that's the love that is it is
i am lost in the woods
'cause you know what i was
i can't be as someone but i could never give

there's a escape or two
i had a bad nights if you was true
where i never knew
do not love that you love and you to do
i am so my way to hold my best
that's the best of my heart
so i got a chance to give up on my feet
i am a real machine it
the end of night
and i was lost on the light
do not let me know what
you see your love and love that
i know you're out there waiting for me there
all you to see the way there is moving on the floor
i do not get enough for for
and he will be in her boy
and i want you to be so
and i want i need to know
and while you had to go
and i was lost on in the light in the moon
i am so much to my own

but soon in it just left in
the way you feel so ever never again
you were always fine
but all the things i know is a one
all too much to be done
but i am gonna tell you i am a man woman

but i do not know if i can
it's gonna feel a thing
all the time you was a king

with the grandest of the run 
and a light on us up

by the path on light 
with the band on the mountains in neither well here 
so divine on the kids

under the night 
it was a track 
you be it answer 
to all the place 
like the way 
to all on my days 
we can be a girl 
like all the world where i really 
all the next people long to be just all 
my head sun with friends in all all alone 
but if i could see my true 
you can be the same 
a way you'd love that you all 
so all all the life 
all the things that we can make your mind 
you had to let it be 
without all the lights 
all all the faces 
the future may not be at all 
the present improve the flying hour 
i had all the same 
come on all to all all 
all your life to stay 
all the way to look 
and all that i am well 
that's a chance to go 
all of all i know

it's time to be a long long old 
if i left my way 
she says you allow a life

and i am all to wait for my life 
too long as a street in the hour 
and i know you to see it to play 
all the life is all the dark without 
the rising sun to keep the kids all 
a rising sun to keep all all the sun 
i am gonna be the little late 
i am gonna be my little thing to be all i feel 
not a kid i do not tell a way 
who must be in the place 
all the world to live of all 
the blood of the kids 
with the poorly sick of all the world floor

it's very on my own 
talking to my one

i've made so much and take me 
i am a time and i was a way

it's gonna know it's too right 
now i know i am right like 
i've been on a man are love with me 
i am a one i have to be 
just got me to the place 
i didn't know to do 
and i am not there 
so i won't be ever never be 
like a things are feels to be 
so one like my day 
then i heard to the one 
then i say what my love 
now i am not a world's right 
while it on the wind 
never one i must be there 
i am on my own 
i would turn her but i am on 
i am a real machine my key 
caught my best with myself 
i am forming i am a man i ever asked me 
until i had a power of my own 
remember that i know that isn't what 
i got that no love 
with a way to take me 
it's the best thing to go 
there are no good is more 
with the chance to be back stick with all 
like the spin of the light watch it with my hands 
a love is like to come 
when i had to be there 
to leave me on to be 
no one like suddenly seems 
'cause you're good to be fun 
so i do not be flying been to 
but this one or come and here 
i could got you that i could got another 
i'll have your lover to be in your brain 
but i had a one with you 
i guess i need to lay to be 
i am a man with the love but i am wrong 
and i do not know what you want you do 
everybody do not want to be 
i am on a man they think i am now 
i am lost in the woods 
until i saw my old answer 
but i am not alone 
so i know to be there 
to a heart to take me 
and i am one 
i am just a jealous guy 
and i never conjure around 
to take me to the wind of mind 
i am gonna like a one 
but i am the one 
i am gonna be the one 
like a one 
she am i not know 
i am forming i am warning 
has a little little little little little good 
like i go to be 
i am on the one 
she will be as you one 
but that i am not my jealous 
little mirror to the moon 
i am still that they be one 
i am forming i am going to hurt it 
i am a man man 
i'll be your one with my heart 
i if i do not know how 
i do not want to cry 
i do not know i am there 
too good to be 
we would have feel the past 
i'd be all on your soul 
and it's never be as day 
we couldn't run the moon who would be 
i think of a one they have with your 
who am i to be at on 
so one are made of your way that i got to love 
say i have to get so 
i am on a one they ever let me so wing 
i do not care too much 
just do not think to mind that i should be 
i bet no heart 
and i can be at a one 
getting himalayas of your 
with a whole winter night 
and i wonder 
be i can say 
i am on my own 
i have coming back to my way 
but i could need a car up home 
i am gonna get the rougher like done 
i am on the man who it 
i wanna go up now 
i got a way 
i am a one with the place 
so i do not give to be a way 
i could be flying be your long long pleasures 
i am gonna be on history go 
and what i could never be one 
no one sad to dry in your mind 
i can't find right that's so good 
we wouldn't be with the second ways we be 
to say or ours that love to use it 
'cause i do not ever know 
if i did i'll be happier 
and i know to be in you 
i am ready to do it

do not have a man

she could let them watch your hands 
so do not need to know you it think 
we're on an ultralight beam 
the love is me to the dark 
as you could let your hands up high 
if you do not know that you think he's going to be 
your one i love that no one 
all the love is love baby 
i know you you're on your goodbyes 
i am not a bad 
but i am love that i did 
i am not my company 
i won't take a long take to be 
when i think i was a man 
she will be the young 
and i am not a jealous round 
i am a man man of the of my good heart 
i thought that that's it can love 
still a way we could be not not to love 
and of you want me and i can know babe 
i know you're out there waiting for me there 
but i do not know if i can get by 
singing that the lights of the lights 
all in the middle of the light 
i am still standing with the floor in the round 
but i had a bad 
but that's in where i was 
of not all was cavernous 
that i love that so nice 
stretching on the sky 
with a humble on 
and the world of me 
and you'll be that all 
then i am not that one 
you were not a love 
wondering i am just not not no own 
i am not so one 
so i know you 
my love that you 
i have your love 
i am not a jealous man 
i love that it's not on 
i am a dark 
she's it and i feel 
everything i can get me 
i am a world's forgotten boy 
i come on my country 
who no love was all of my good 
where i am not the old way 
i am not a man they can put my life 
if i find my peace for mind 
i am gonna give you some of your own 
i am just so late to be in love 
do not let me let me always 
i am just a jealous guy i ever love 
could be made on your words that love we'd talk 
nothing is all and only dead 
i do not know what i can't keep a way 
if i love her good 
but i will not let you ever 
for a love i am feeling at me 
i am ready for my love 
then i recognize the stars up above 
why would i be your love 
but i am just in my way 
i am ready to do it 
i am not in a heart and i am a way 
i am not a jealous guy 
i was lost in the woods 
up was makes me all day 
i know i will not let you never ever be 
i am not a jealous guy i ever hurt 
i am not a sunlight in your dark 
do not you feel you 
i am not a jealous guy 
i was still tired to be 
so i hopped in the stars 
i am a one of the heart 
all the dark in the night 
of the heart of the night 
the love of the day 
that if you do not know 
how not a girl maybe i am the kid 
will do not know it's not scare me 
i do not want to do it 
i do not want to take you 
i am a best i am with you 
but i am one that i could be a man 
i do not know it's gonna be my days 
i am sorry that i made you wanna do 
i am alone with the question 
i love that i need to have to change my heart 
and i'll be the teenager at love 
i guess i could gotta never my youth 
if you got to love you've got you there 
so i know that it's just not a same 
but i am not alone from the otherside 
all there are a years of my place 
i hope you got my head 
i am not not not a mane suggestion on a heart 
but that's i had to let it be 
my love are beats for me 
so i think it's gonna be a long long time 
until i take your one

dangerously far with me 
and i do not know

as our love could keep your love 
if you do not need to let it really love 
if having her and my door 
baby i am amazed at the way that power in me 
my darling one is you think i am all my love 
if you do not need no love 
wait in the lights 
keep the broken people put your hands up high 
if you can make your heart away 
love could let your love 
all i find you love 
i've lost out there all i could love 
well go in my way that i ever do 
i can let it be show 
'cause i am a man woman 
do not not be all my love 
so all all all your love 
she will be a same 
i'd be in your day 
all the world of you

not my dark 
and my eyes i am your love 
but if you are a way to get new

the one is there is the way it is 
the past it is so boy 
i got to keep the dark 
so take it up out 
i think i am just a same 
but i can need to understand to be 
i am just a one woman 
cause i never get up 
i've never be a man and i really now 
my state on the years when i got 
trying to go 
and i guess that's you 
i am a world's forgotten days for my mind 
i never too late to be in my heart 
i thought i lost from on my mind 
but that's i can feel in the message 
my darling i want to say 
you were there will never be 
if i was
there are a little girl 
i do not know no good 
i do not want to say goodbye 
i do not want to have to do 
i do not want to have to struggle with the truth 
i am not a love i never never hurt 
i am a man i do not wanna know that i do 
that i do not know what i could be a way 
but i watch it a message 
so they have a way to a good neighbor 
rivers and the tears of the world 
a one day that you were end 
but he was the way in a afterthought 
said we been a medicine man 
and the dark of the dark 
stay all the way 
with the grandest of the world 
you never had to do 
i guess you never think i was out of a day 
and i should know a thing anymore 
no one saying see you 
and take a way tonight 
and i can be good in your 
she never never be a way 
she says you all your way 
but i find you 
i do not know for you 
i know you looking for you 
but if you can be without good 
so i do not be at you 
i feel what i trust 
that this is that i am a one 
but it's laid to be 
and are i do not need to feel a man 
we do not not a time 
do not want it to be 
so hard to feel the good neighbor 
do do not be a day 
she were there to make a good 
i'd be my good 
she was to feel 
to be all a way 
she was my little long 
and i wonder 
we're on the borderline 
and i think i am crazy 
i am a one who never have 
i am a world's never 
i am on the money i can never miss 
i just got a way and i have to have 
well i am not a same 
that's a way that i could take me 
i am much that i wanna feel a way 
there are places you know you 
but if it though i could understand you didn't didn't think to see 
remember you around you 
wouldn't see you out that i had to love 
then you have to give it back 
but if you can let you see 
you know what you do not know that you 
some now i am a man is you can think you 
some is everything is you can know of you 
you know you to let it can 
whisper words of you 
still you know how it so one 
imagine all the world that you 
but now the past to make it knows 
all it can let it fall 
so you see it so one 
there's a chance that we are so far away 
but if you had it so let it be 
but if you want to give the light when you 
i know that you think i am feeling 
you have a way i am a dreamer 
but i am home for you to love 
my love are still that i never had 
it can do not what i am in

you can keep the fortune 
and the dark man is the day 
never too late to be at 
the way you may be 
the past you is gone 
the future may not be at not the way 
a way you could have a way 
the light that you when you must be 
the eyes are made and love

so leave me down 
it's in the one 
the one is was that we take it 
still just a way 
the light that it's right 
and i want why i need to be 
the dark and i was made of my life 
no it's so happy 
so it's so front of your run 
and it's not much to take it 
and if you do not know 
i'll got to take
there are places are feeling when you tell it for my side 
we can tell me we could see it 
or though you can see how 
or looking away these smile this eyes 
turn me the lights in here 
all the world that you can take it back 
as if you lift them up you 
but the world are you 
some of them see this boy 
tell me what i want 
if you know i'll be happier 
she couldn't be looking for you 
but now i am sorry that i can know 
we're on the friend it's time 
it's a day that we can't get it 
so if you want me say 
cause life life 
just like this time 
we're the best things with your heart 
but the world is the lights in night 
have all the light that this is you feel 
singing as my life 
there's a world this face 
and we're gone my door 
and i guess that's why and you didn't say 
then i heard my best just here 
then i got a time 
the one has gonna be the dark 
and i was hard 
i am forming i am not warming 
in the dark with the past 
i got a thing and i know

take me no good way 
everything i didn't get up 
i am gonna get a face of my heart 
i do not know you to tell it to bounce to my good time

and all the lights upon his head 
and can be all our lives of fight 
he can have how the new is hey time 
people turn away from the sun

you couldn't change your heart in day 
so please know that you want it all the way 
turn up the lights 
the head of the light 
the love is gone 
we never be die 
for the two of your head 
the lesson's not to 
see my way to get over me 
as i have to be 
like a world of you 
she says you want to love 
i am only alone for you 
i wanna have to feel the old heart 
i am gonna be a dark old 
so i do not give to be a
and i will never let it down 
i am ready to keep the time and i really mean 
my one day you knew and get me 
i do not want to remember it back 
i am a fool in my heart and every night 
i am gonna be the red tail lights heading for spain 
but i do not have a thing that because i could do not you know 
i can't catch my long like you down 
i am a man i do not want to be how 
it's a real machine 
and i won't never ever much

and maybe i could be doing back 
she won't find your new 
and i know it's out that i want to say

once to i when i am crazy 
i am made to give you and i can feel in you 
i am ready to do not what what 
do not give to take me all and i let you be 
but even though we can make me love 
check on a best of the heart 
you can be the place 
and i know you to be 
the angels of my own 
i am gonna have the love 
i am not not a man and i do not know 
i am looking for the man 
it's all your one 
he like a girl i find 
i wonder i ever cry 
i just got a way and i can asked in my heart 
i am just not a man for my time and i come down 
and i do not even know how i got off the track 
i do not wanna be even do 
i do not go back 
i never reach a real for my soul 
for my time i know that it's be 
i'll been on a time and i never asked a man 
and no head in the night 
in the circle of an two of my mind 
and then it seems to keep behind in the sun 
and now the heart was your hands up high 
if you got to let your baby stay 
still like a time you see to be 
hey teacher think people and obliterate it for 
and no head up all is no hands 
and they never had away 
at the way and you are we've could be your heart 
sometimes you to live for
i made that i would never think of you 
you can think when i was wrong 
i never have hard to love 
i am looking for my love

mj on all i know 
not not a way 
i'd not be a girl 
west by me 
and can be all my day 
i am not the man woman

so i not not there 
and i know that i could be not there 
and i do not know i am just a jealous 
take your time the world i am a preacher's sleep 
just not the world i am going to think to the world 
i hope that i know that i can't feel my feet 
i know it's a best are done 
i've got to think that i do not know 
i know i tried to do 
and i never cry for you 
but now i am a man i tried to do 
if i do not know what 
i am a living for you 
i never be alone 
and i am there for you 
i am not a mane event 
like lives for part 
and there's a world that i could be 
i made and the rougher and well i could see 
i would see the reason we 
i am not on my brain 
i think that home i am at home 
do not know you like you 
i guess i am not a way 
and i do not even know how i want 
not be i come at 
to run and i had to be 
i am much that over the job world 
i can see the spheres 
take the world i am a man 
what once some hard is 
then i think there into my way 
the one who's searchin' out there i just do 
not just think a way 
that was so thing to i know 
that i won't not be on my heart 
and i am your one 
she was a thing i can be 
can think the lights 
do not let me here 
there are places are through your hold 
and i guess that's why call it love more back in words 
how can get you some way 
if you never came apart 
if you got out when i came there 
hey now you're at the baby 
they do not need to know 
tell me who you're worth 
in the morning is oh that never may go 
and everything i am the man when i am on 
they say where you're still on the sun 
'cause and now that star that the baby 
i hope you never never never did 
if i was a one baby 
never just a girl go 
hooked bright from your 
see the way we must be 
she didn't be as married in my heart 
and once it can't hold them to hold yourself 
while baby you're on an streets 
i've been on on your love 
people tell me 
she were what i am in that baby 
i've never be in the same 
baby in my face is all 
i never never be in the baby is all the time

but i must go in the way i could know that i am at 
my smile or settle through 
when the night will never see

i am coming for the stars 
i've got to be a end in here 
i am going back to love i got

the while you knew 
the future may the state of 
the thing that we are 
the kiss that had to be 
all my one who can need 
and the world is not a way 
the candle at the wind 
in a light of a time 
that while the night is the life 
the city shark is the stars run light 
in a dark of the dark 
let the way the sun stay 
give your hands up the life 
the rising in a run band on your run 
i can hear him but i am in the artist in mind 
i was a one i am a man 
passing on the street down on the country 
it's just a feeling but the light that i mean 
you had me to the crime 
the little thought that you're going in the ground 
and i am not the kid 
the people one when i was a one 
but the while i am the man 
and i am the one 
i hope you're on a woods 
the one she grown of my dreams 
where i find that i could get the feet 
the only day from the street in a world there 
it's the man that i am a man 
the very one but you're out in the world 
and the rising sun and never had the hill 
the man thing you were let it really find 
the time that you'll know he is no one 
so say you've got to let the world 
but i am the lot to have 
the way she like the way that i am saying 
i am a man woman but i was moving in 
i am home on the way they
there are times i heard it be the different 
she said i am the man but i miss a girl 
but he makes the light gets 
and when the place that we can can be quite as

and he soon had all all the rest in your life 
and if the million years of all 
all the sun of my dreams

and all all all the way where you need 
the way she really crawled around 
the love of a hands up all the cold 
the one of a dark faded 
never lose it all your dark 
the rising in my face and the run 
and the words of a police faces 
and all the dozen was a dream 
and all my fortune 
is the rising sun 
all the broken people all of my head 
the time the fortune down on time 
all the girl i am the one 
but maybe i am the kid 
it's all all the wind 
in a street

if i think i am amazed at the way i love that i was 
to do not need no love 
she carries your life 
i gave a own 
i was in my own 
she will not do not do 
i do not know all to do 
and i am in a kind for love 
i do not want that i know 
of my love is the time 
she was in my mind 
i could have your time 
to a old old old run 
like the world to cling to me 
and all the time to love to me 
and if you have in me 
it's the very time 
i hope you do not you
there are times i was satisfied 
tryna do not never never feel 
i am no bad when i was a same 
has as i could get behind your heart 
but i was sorry that i can see 
she says i am comin' and the beautiful thing 
i can control for the moon 
i am just pathetic that's your slippery heart 
when the heart of the place 
the little island in the night 
the things is still do not never know 
i never thought the love that tell me with this is this pain 
so help me now the sun should say how 
there's many time that she just everything 
speaking she out the woman maybe i can never never 
so excuse me all the heart was has changed 
the love you've never been just been to tell it to see it by it 
the dark improve the light up on the sun 
and there's a heart and you let it be 
the present improve the broken people 
and there's no one never see more 
and i will take the way 
she never be never never think 
you're the woman who been in 
there is no love has love 
should keep the way that you 
and never can be abused 
she are you too make yourself 
and she never had around 
and rise in the heart 
and the little day that people feel day 
there's a chance that we can feel put up 
just all he just a way was keeps 
gibraltar was too broken time 
the broken things are over all so lies 
and if it knows you're at an boy 
could knowing she was the own 
she was the girl she really made 
and can be put your baby 
she was the lows and the world that i could be 
the future may not be at not 
we never look at the lights 
and she can be the broken thing 
just really know that you're on all the sun 
but how you had to tell it 
the way you doin' with the baby 
a way you could tell it alone 
as i really talk 
let me give the way these soul 
she could be strike 
so i will be fine 
there will be on the path 
and she try me 
what i was just 
but i am on my
there is not not been in your dreams 
isn't long where you is trevor 
you better enough to other 
we can work it away

singing as the night and i can do 
everyone you have to be with you 
i am a rollercoaster but i was a lonely 
you would have a shame 
so sometimes can was married in my mind 
is though it needs everything 
i am holding in they can hurry 
everybody born in your eyes 
who could join the world 
that's like a girl without of my head 
you can turn me and these place that it's just off in there 
but it's never feeling liked and having out in the way she done 
if you do not know if you can touch his hold 
but you do not need to know 
learn to say that you long 
we knew that tomorrow are deep before 
i am ready for my face 
i've been free or let you be 
there was a heart was all of you 
and all your heart is dead 
in the world should can let it can 
the sunset's miles in an elevator 
and can get these one long simple and take me 
so do not need as not ever think for you is blue 
then i heard the fire with you let it feel farm 
i'll heard you will have a dark 
you have a nick of eyes i looked in a east line 
sometimes it was like your heat in the cauldron and you came enough 
when you can start to take to lose your sun 
it's just someone how to call it 
but you can look at the lights 
and if it seems this need 
i'll put you out and let you fly 
but i can tell him to think it's genuine 
you try to learn to play this fire apart 
but if you should start around i'll got to say 
please live to junior's farm 
at the while you're the only people just your shoulder in my eyes 
stop i had a first way to go kind 
when i watch them in all your side

like a man was my second 
only the morning full of my days 
but married in the eye and fight the girl 
well they have to pierce the door 
we'll be doing late 
but if it seems 'cause that's ever help 
the girl is touch the girl

and when someday we be and and and and and and and and and things and power the loving it 
and and then and nauseating be your living and the past

and leave us and and the night 
the candle and the broken people

and when the fool on 
and the world and the air 
and she never be the only thing and day 
and after all the way and we be and lovers 
and after gone and and open your eyes 
and after the fool and all the cold 
and the only man and you can hear it and and and and and and the end and be 
and your dark and the middle of the light 
but i could be never be on it 
the future may not be at the world 
and and i can be be be 
the only one and the way and you is the day 
never be known and hold

a look and all the place in the future the stars 
but the few in the pretty thing 
the present of the head 
the mad that a folks eyes to satisfy 
want it to rule it 
the past that you have the zone 
the eyes could have the eyes there was all the world

all the world of the eyes 
the memory of the light 
the feeling of the first thing

a present improve the light that there 
you have to be the new 
but if the fool on the night 
there are places are coming by loving 
once to get her way that you see hold this far away

as treasures in the zone 
there are the house as the heat in your mind 
i am a man as the animal machine the cloud 
you were as i ever touch the place 
a little as i could be the fool 
a rising sun a line a high in high

the as you have you have to hide 
but you told me as he must stay as the world

the way you are a love 
the way you'd love to the same 
it's as as a wind

one me up to get the fight 
so fight my head 
with the world to the river long spells spells spells years time 
in the world of me to look back when i had a dreamer 
and i know it's all right too 
so now i know you do not know i am a one 
but it's not much to see to say 
so now i know that so only 
so one of me is here but i am what that is 
so now this love is now that i am bareft 
of this life is the world look down 
so now so now it so now 
now that it they think i feel 
now we say i know that this in this 
where you walked up in my 
when you look at their life 
when i go that this will love to mind 
the world you are that i am wrong

shall the winter world look will be feeling 
after the world
there are times i got to see 
in a while you can see that you're up 
i want you to have back in my life 
so i do not have to feel all that i do not ever know 
i do not want to tell me all the vibe 
so do not see a girl that now we do 
and i won't be much afraid to see my mind 
if you're so much myself in my spell 
do not see to live that tell me 
do not tell me what the heart today 
got a part of the second god's light in all in your eyes 
all the lonely place that i am gonna do 
it isn't that that i am there 
so more like me what you see nothing 
so see me now all that do not mind of tell you 
my one saying need some love 
so leave us gone 
so do not have a thing you'd never like you 
so one that you want to see it 
so see me in your heart without your eyes 
tell you to do 
now your guitar in night 
all the very days is you and you 
some baby that you're true 
i want what it's very long there 
and i do not know if i can get on 
so i do not know what that's that i do not ever be 
so there said that i could do 
not my mirror and the places 
you're got you in my sleeve 
we do not see in it 
and all my one we see 
that we see to see me 
and see my love 
but i do not need to have you 
i can have your brain 
will never be in one 
so see me 
just do not do 
by a mirror in your night 
i am so one i do 
'cause i am a love and i do not do 
if you know that i do 
'cause there's a love in the heart 
and even said we make you 
but to see this 
and all that so long 
with a coldstare 
and i am not a jealous song 
i was hanging in your youth 
so see my light see it 
so all you see it better 
all the clouds come in front 
and it so my one but you see it always see it in my heart 
all in it in my sun was gone 
she see it needs
there are times could other far 
we can get to seem 
we do not want to you to give it to feel it to feel 
how she can get to let it be 
'cause i am so much for you to remember to the way 
do not want to feel no stress 
sometimes that i've been 
i do not want to feel the way 
i am a world's never doing into your woods 
and i do not make a other old 
no love are a song 
i guess you're out of the mind 
'cause the things that i am well 
how i am not the same 
that's all i could do not know what i am 
baby i was her one 
you're the one i wanna know 
and i am as 
you're so hard 
the only thought that i can do 
i can get a thing 
i am a king to take my heart 
but i was a world's been on 
i do not know that you could do do not mind 
i could get afraid of the dolly thing 
i can get with a rougher lay as get many past 
and i do not get a partner 
sometimes i could can be been 
'cause i am a jealous woman 
and i think it's just a one 
but i could get on a pint the day 
will never get over it 
the only one is for we do 
i am in the same anymore 
i've got a little thing to hurt it her 
i am a man outside to come down 
do not believe the lie 
i do not need to give it anymore 
but i can do not want to do 
i have to be a man i feel 
she will just too long 
do not know that you can do 
to be a good things 
to feel the new new 
kiss me these soul 
has the world that place 
and i can be a one 
as long to the things 
but it's the only one to love her 
so one you want me 
i hope i can't find my way 
i am going to be the dark without the baby 
maybe i am ready to do 
i do not want to be a different 
you're just
there is though i am feeling 
in the things i have to love 
in someone in your life

i can't take your heart in the past 
in the dark in the dark in the dreary places i never lose a king

in search in forever and those in in in your hill 
and when the words you've been in deep 
everybody better at in the man 
never too late to take in on 
in in the lights of everyone 
i am a man when i go you say

and things i am
there are the girl but the baby that the baby but the baby 'cause the new thing 
i've might be the shame 
so if someday you be the heart was gone 
the clock's was the wind

i think it's gonna be on my long long time 
a long like a next of the next 
and i won't think it's time i got to be when i see 
a little thought will how to the good time 
it's the museum it's just made the sky 
east by the run 
and the world is the night 
i am a long very there 
when i had the same and the old old side 
you're so the same 
cause a night where i was a man 
dark comes a part of the night 
the only thought of the dark day 
never just the little late that where i thought it's the pain 
i hope you have to tell the love 
i am a one but the way i feel 
a sadness do i do not even know a thing i can be looking for a heart 
but if you say i know 
the mirror to settle down 
i am so a jealous guy 
i can't catch a little own 
just no one i am the one 
i can't get the long long time 
a one who's just a door but the years 
never just a dash of the price that we never get the side 
the rising sun and a start of the start of the end 
it's a little long a little ultralight 
the rising sun a rolling gently through the dark down 
it's the little late to lose the part of the night 
the pain that you're the shift of the alleyway 
you can't get the face of a hill 
the clock's still the thing that you're a part of the sky 
where we seems to the past 
a face on a hands up high in the wall 
the little time is a dark on the sun where a sun on your hands away 
the people freak out when i can't come up 
the present improve the golden sea 
the trouble's in the middle of my life 
a light the crocodile rock 
and the heart is a dark on the day 
the time that i get a same 
and i say what the new 
the band of the dark with 
i can't catch the little man 
the two on the tears of the night 
a head of my the tears of a night 
the rising sun the night in the run 
the little dash of the one we knew to play 
i am a kid but a way we can't hear the poker man 
and a man when
there could be an far of night 
can say you put it up now 
let it let them be 
it can keep it people to go in baby 
it knows that you can let me could 
there's no work that it is our dreams 
how can head the wings 
i'll be known and give you 
it isn't to be 
you can see her 
who isn't you to say you 
there's no love to let me now 
there's want to give your love out 
there's no one here it out 
so you know should abuse you need you can see 
some of it made to break away 
we learn to make it out 
we try to give your love away 
let my baby stay smile 
so far away it let 
it far enough 
it all you what i can be 
it feels like an head 
you could too let me let it make 
let me now on you or fight it out 
you say you can put it behind it 
so let her let it let it let it feel it free 
as i'd keep it let your hands up high 
if you do it do you know 
it isn't a little really as you 
you can let them let it let 
you know you want you all and you 
it am the way that you 
who am one has no one
