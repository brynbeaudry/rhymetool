and it's a thing that i need to do
and i won't ever be afraid
and now i can't get paid
i was home i wish you made
standing on the edge
and it makes a while
someone had to get it all 
for a smile
to the ones that you ask
is the one i keep the nights
well the world that we really no one
but there's a same thing in the sun
the time you run
i guess i won't be free
i can take it all the hundred 
we're going to play up
