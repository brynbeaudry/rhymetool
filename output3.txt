no money they can say
that i don't know how to say
let them know you say
but you can say
the love i love to say
that's why i say
so i said things would be right
that i know that you're so right
then you'll never be right
everybody could be alright
but i guess i can get right
than time to get ya right
and i won't think i'll be alright
i couldn't sit born less right

I'll know it's you
when you remember at the line and i held you
you won't find you
but if you ain't doing you better than you
when i wanted you
but it's too much to listen to you
you're not like you
they were calling you
i guess i thought you

no one can be
i was so long my eyes
but not with my own eyes
and this is how i could in your eyes
turn it down all the eyes
i swear
i didn't believe my love i swear
i was out for my brain i was a blame
anymore now don't fight
the different thing is a fight
i will find your time
i am a long time
do you have a lover or the time
in my life and the time
about yourself and a side of time
i feel a lover of the wrong time
you believe in time
never wanna do a first time
would be the time
i don't want to cause it's gonna be a real long time
i should write a little time
so we gave you a nice time
around the angels of time
everything is my time
to find some time
it's all i've been feeling
you were standing 'cause i used to say that i should explain
looking than a only lonely heart and play
i don't want a living getting
i thought that it's not waiting
any road will ever did
that i'll be the one you did
the coldest story will ever did
and i could take you to bring a little side
well you was shining inside
a wave being real has much inside
and in the very side
on my face
i don't want to tilt my face
i'd fear to me show me girl
i thought i could be a girl
she said you were wrong girl
i see you girl
i don't see you girl
i won't fill my girl
i bet that money build the weed
even be a leaves that silly let up fly
so i want you to fly
mister as a dirty
everybody wants to be a hole
just stuck on the kids
i can't be a man
we've made to hear my man
i am a man
very much i am my man
i feel to get it
how you gon' do what you can see it
well i love her and i love it
i'm just lose it
born to get it
you're born to get it
they had the out this to it
i can't help it
so i swear i sing it
everybody made me be in it
try to meet it
i know you never made it
i can believe it
you don't even know it
come on come on come on i feel it
what have you gonna find
i came on my mind
and we were behind
to break my little point of mind
i'm going to find
even can be the little mind
i don't care in my mind
but i would never hear my mind
when you just lose your mind
i know you just feeling back for your mind
i was lost in my mind
i held myself  in the ringing floor
of your broken misery
'cause it's not the way tonight
so i guess i can't wait to show you tonight
she said you gon' be feeling leaving you tonight
and the world is the end of the night
how how i want to take it it a night
seeping out your skull into into the night
but i can't forget you tonight
take it through the night
and i couldn't lose you tonight
walking back dead
i wish you were dead
'cause you're talking about
they were talking 'bout
but i held her hiding about
until you feel so sad
you were alone
i can't be alone
your real sign comes out alone
i could be alone
part of pain
but he's so far to play my pain
and i can hold it with you denied
who i can answer
i've got something for my own
i'd live for our own
Their will had to break
there's nothing to break
on the morning it's doing a world
and i feel this world
to the end of the world
somewhere in the world
everybody wants to rule the world
i don't need the world
no road goes on the world
i bear the whole world
i would be so sad in the world
kiss the one to the world
and no more
and you don't love me no more
even if i know that i was more
and there's no one anymore
just like an same
check into an dope hands in a same
and i was the same
it's gonna be the same
i've been a real long i am the same
lost your heart
that i would start
i'm a woman in my heart
i don't know my heart
that we have known
we lost the same knowledge that we have known
when we could be known
all on my arms
but i would be the best
and i'm not on the best
when i can bleed without you crying
shout out of the street
and i would have beautiful trees
lost in the woods
to put down the dying of change
you gotta talk you now my head will change
There was hell to pay
but it was almost too late
i hope you tried to cut the rules
if you live in the golden storm
all the devil that you blow and warm
every time has lost
every night is two pink many place has lost
the beautiful to change the cut
'cause i could never have to give
there's nothing that to forgive
drowning in the space
take a lesson from the wise
sheâ€™s a mirror to the sky
i was
hope I'm never where I was
i read the pack of me but i was
oh how it was
not enough
once bright but never proved enough
come back on on
it and i'm on
and then i could break it on
right now come on
hold it come on come on
i was coming on
you'll be holding on
i know you on
alone and i'll be holding on
but i couldn't be for myself
and then you know yourself
i think i get myself
it's coming anyway
the world you can't see
all the way that we loved the sea
the only want it to see
looking like a time to see
i thought you know it's going to see
and i know if you see
that you can be known and was what i see
i had my strength to see
what i want to see
i was a real machine that you can see
mother should you see
standing on the edge
take to see around the way
until i'm telling you i see this way
cause you go with run over the way
but i am the way
now you blow in my smile and i can blow your old way
think i guess i call my way
that it's not it way
to a little of the way
take a sheet from off your bed
some of the one thing you're doing
the last time i could you lose
so i couldn't lose
i hope you got to lose
i saw all the price
no one life
i'm just a reason i'm your life
gave it all into your life
i looked into my life
each one of my life
all around the life
i won't never say i was not in life
why tell me how life
and i can't get back
i was coming back
so i don't wanna be my best keeps back
the matter you hold you back
i gotta get back
don't get back now go 'head come back
so long
no one and long
so the only thing you belong
it would be so long
i was home i wish you made
love every time i want you to do
i did it i do it and i want to do
i don't know what i do
don't be the one i do
the kids is feeling to do
and it's a thing that i need to do
you wonder what you do
i keep back somehow
you don't think that you already know if you were too cool for my friends
see you here at my friends
you are high to tell your friends
i took her out to cut your ass through the sand
so i wouldn't try to understand
i'm just a cold band
round and round and i wonder
under a door
we fell through the door
always afraid to talk and you're half out the door
so when you play through to play my door
i guess you might spend my family
i laugh in the world and anytime
daniel you should be stronger
hot though i was foul
though i wrote the record room in my lies
lies set up their open goodbye
don't meet you to say goodbye
i can't blow you off
i find love
all the rest of love
with all your boy will give me love
'cause she's a kind of love
i'm a real machine of love
i'm gonna be your love
i can't get my love
i feel the lonely love
because you may be over love
but you put me out of love
when her kind heart blows up
i guess i don't wanna catch up
and if you don't wanna stand up
i can take it all the hundred we're going to play up
no promises, no patience
i saw the dreams you keep
i won't be a real machine
i'm a man i'm a real machine
i saw the highest through the ghost
burn the truth 'til you rolling on the week
i can't stop
when she was born to stop
welcome to the burning cut out a top
when i can't stop
someone had to get it all for a smile
you can take you down to say let's be done
wombat with the sun
but there's a same thing in the sun
what's something hopping and left his car
always a words with dream that though no one went from some car
welcome to the open julia
i saw her
if you should see you should speak her
if you see her
i was thinking of the game
don't look a shall cut the card from the game
so when you're finna go trip before i was become
sleep or though i wonder before about build the track
and if you can get it cry
and i was born to cry
'cause i can't be so nice
i ain't so nice
why i feel so long so nice
until I see the light
so i saw her off the news light
you play the man out of the light
make you get and it's my light
you're gonna let you make your light
but i would tell you all my mind without you that
but you already know and i would see that
you want a change that
i'm the man that
and you don't know that
i'd be around who could be so good
and i know that it's gonna be so good
i could never feel
and tell me what i feel
i was waiting to feel
no matter what i feel
i hope you feel
i feel a way now that you feel
the wave is brought the dice
number one is a truth
this i caught the truth
don't talk to between the future
i guess i won't be free
can i turn to being free
i don't want to stop my brain
and it's my rain
we can work it with me again
i wanna do it again
every road is a fool
then you new other though i call it little fool
but i was money and keep my ass today
is the one i keep the nights
so when four nights

and i went down

and i guess i was born
i might pass it all in
in the sun we were in
the old time you knew
as a year falls
i make
there's all the ways
and love nobody and i can
i still know i can
just look out of songs
i didn't mean
and i know that you came
so some
look at your voice
and i know that i was seen
you beat
the sun is going
and it makes a while
the time you run
sometimes i hate
for the words but you did the story
to the ones that you ask
i need the sound of freedom
but i need the king
